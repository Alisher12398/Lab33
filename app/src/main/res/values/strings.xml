        TP-Link has been enjoying a very good run on Amazon.com. Two of the companys Alexa-enabled smart plugs have dominated Amazons electric
        plugs best-seller list for most of this year, helping the Chinese manufacturer sell thousands of plugs.
        Unfortunately for TP-Link, its about to get fresh competition from Amazon itself. The e-commerce giant last month held a product launch event in Seattle,
        where it unveiled a long list of new devices including the Alexa-enabled Amazon Smart Plug. The plug goes on sale for $25 next week, a few bucks more than TP-Links plugs.

        There was no space for Burnley keeper Hart in Southgate 25-man squad for the upcoming matches against Croatia and Spain in the UEFA Nations League.
        Instead, Southgate selected uncapped duo Marcus Bettinelli and Alex McCarthy along with Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford as his goalkeeping options.
        A series of impressive displays for the Clarets has seen Hart keep his place in goal ahead of fellow club team-mates Tom Heaton and Nick Pope.

        Here come Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 in plan to simplify 802.11 networking names

        The idea is to be clearer about whats better and what your phone or home router can handle without sounding as much like an electronic engineer.
        Not that theres anything wrong with electronic engineers, but even techies can have a hard time remembering that IEEE 802.11 means wireless networks,
        IEEE 1394 governs FireWire data connections, and IEEE 802.3 is about Ethernet network connections.
        The underlying Wi-Fi specifications will keep their IEEE technical names, of course. The Wi-Fi Alliance comes later in the development process,
        just before the point when consumers get involved, smoothing the way with compatibility tests that let device manufacturers put reassuring certification
        logos on their product boxes.
